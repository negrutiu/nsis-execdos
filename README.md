# ExecDos ([NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) plugin)
It allows you to execute console programs and grab their output<br>
The plugin is included in my **unofficial** [NSIS builds](https://github.com/negrutiu/nsis)

This is a clone of the original project created by **Takhir Bedertdinov** and **Stuart 'Afrow UK' Welch**<br>
